// Package directive turns the single-entry `term` tool's `cmd` string into
// statements: which directive, which target, which flags, and — the part that
// must not be re-derived anywhere — the payload, taken as a SLICE OF THE SOURCE
// rather than re-assembled from parsed words.
//
// It parses with the real shell grammar (mvdan.cc/sh/v3/syntax) and never
// evaluates: `$HOME` in a payload is not expanded here, it is handed to the
// shell that will expand it. The rule that makes the whole format work is the
// one in the issue that produced this package: every word in `cmd` must be a word
// the shell itself can parse. `#` is a comment character, so a locator can never
// start with one — `run #a1f3:1 'x'` parses to just `run`, and that is reported
// as an error rather than silently fixed up.
//
// Two shapes exist, and the difference is a property of the directive:
//
//	payload  (run, alias):        everything after the target is raw bytes
//	flags    (key, read, file, …): --name[=value] after the target
//
// `pipe`/`pty` are payload directives whose `--argv` flag takes the REST of the
// statement: an argv is a word list (`--argv sh -c 'echo hi'`), and reading only
// the word after the flag would silently drop the program's arguments.
//
// Flags go AFTER the target, never before: `key --repeat 3 a1f3:1 up` is
// rejected, because a flag in second position breaks the one positional rule the
// whole syntax rests on ("word 2 is the target").
